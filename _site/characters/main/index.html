</h1>
    <hr /><p>Now 28, Yukiko Amagi spends her days managing her seemingly forgotten family inn. Stuck in the past, she has held onto a petty grudge against her high school boyfriend, Yu Narukami, for over a decade. This, however, has come at the cost of Yukiko's relationships with her friends and family.<br /><br />Today the only people who are willing to associate with her are Nanako Dojima - Yukiko's only employee and Yu's cousin - and Chie Satonaka, her best friend growing up. This is due to her constant negativity and mean spirited behaviour. Between drinking and taking out her frustrations on others, she does not have particularly healthy coping mechanisms.</p></div>

</h1>
    <hr /><p>It is normal for people to change as they grow older, and the freshly graduated Nanako Dojima has certainly changed... albeit for the worse. It's not that the 18 is particularly angst ridden, Nanako just doesn't get along with many people. For those that knew her when she was a mere elementary schooler, the surly tomboy she grew to be was nothing short of a curveball. Gone is the cutesy bundle of joy, here to stay is a spitfire who may kick your ass out of sheer boredom. Provided, that is, there is no baseball game on TV.<br /><br />There are many factors as to why this happened. Assuming the role of police chief when Nanako was 10, her father, Ryotaro, became but a face she'd occasionally see during his exceedingly rare time off. Considering she has effectively raised herself, Nanako is satisfied being as functional as she is. Another major factor, if not the biggest one, is a particularly negative influence in her life: her employer, Yukiko Amagi. Regardless of Yukiko's ill-intent, Nanako has grown quite distant from her cousin, Yu - whom she still refers to as "Big Bro" despite this estrangement.</p></div>

</h1>
    <hr /><p>A teacher at the local middle school, 30 year old Kotone Narukami, née Shiomi, moved to Inaba alongside her husband, Yu, back in 2015. They live together with their seven year old daughter, Miika, in a decently sized duplex. Originally from Nagano, Kotone developed a fascination with both winter sports (ice hockey in particular) and Canada after the 1998 Winter Olympics - a fascination inherited by Miika, an inexplicably gifted athlete who plays for the prefectural Girls' U12 team.<br /><br />Born to a well off (if not privileged) family, Kotone can sometimes come across as aloof. Something which is not at all helped by her untreated, yet admittedly mild ADHD. Kotone's parents, in contrast to Yu's globetrotting parents, are very much involved in her life.</p></div>
