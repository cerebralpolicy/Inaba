## Preface

If you are at all familiar *It's Always Sunny in Inaba* you know that I have up to this point used AI voices. However, in addition to a foray into modding taking time away, my work on the series has ground to a halt, owing to the simple fact that working with AI voices has hindered my enthusiasm.

I am extremely nervous about this, but I have decided that it would be best to move away from AI voices. I'll be the first to admit that the idea of bringing in collaborators is quite scary, I'm disabled and cannot work so... well, I'm not rich by any means. Yet if it is for the best then it's a no brainer. For the sake of consistency this will require going back and redoing the episodes, which is not a big deal for me.

## This Site's Purpose

This site exists to organize the information needed to start the casting process into a central repository. Things like sample scripts for audition, descriptions of how the characters behave, and so forth. It may take me a while to get everything together, in the mean time you're more than welcome to browse around. Feel free to submit a [VA Application](info/applications/) if you are interested in pitching in.

## Name Change

I've decided to title this project *What Happens in Inaba* for two reasons. I've never seen IASIP and I really want to give it a unique name. Most fan projects like this are parodies. While there are elements of parody to be had here, I feels this aligns more with satire as I am still telling a new story.

I also want to spite all the chucklefucks on YouTube uploading "AI Persona parodies" with a genuine piece of art... I never said I was above base pettiness.
